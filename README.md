Data strucutres ideas

tree structure{
    universe
    min, max
    summary
    clusters
}

Student structure{
    name
    roll
    marks
}

college structure{
    name
    branch ptr
}

branch structure{
    seats
    cutoff
}

```

- Insert all college cutoff's in bit vector
- Find successor of student's marks and assign college
    - check for avail seats
- Extra functions we can perform
    - sorting??
